### Code-o-Soccer 2017

This repo contains all the code for Simurosot.  

There'll be a ton of commented code (across all versions/branches). We left them there so that we don't write the same buggy code twice.  

**Version 6.3** contains the code that we submitted for 3 vs 3 matches.  
**Version 7.3** contains the code that we submitted for 5 vs 5 matches.  

Everything above Version 7.0 (inclusive) contains code for 5 vs 5 matches.  
Everything below it contains code for 3 vs 3 matches.

Role switching code is mainly in Game.hpp. Other filenames are self-explanatory.

Master branch contains the same code as v6.3
